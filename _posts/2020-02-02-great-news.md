# Time is a constraint 

I haven't posted anything recently, mainly due to too many things happening.  
In 2019 I've been to 2 conferences and 7 meetups as a speaker.  
I've presented some of my recent work at THE GREATEST conference - [PSConf 2019](https://psconf.eu) and Best Spent Day with PowerShell at [PSDayUK](https://psday.uk).  
If you're interested, all my slides and code are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mczerniawski/Presentations).

I've also had the pleasure to write a chapter for [PSConfBook volume 2](https://leanpub.com/psconfbook2).  
Well, now I can say it was a pleasure, but when I was writing it... Let's just say it is a brand new experience in my Spell Book. :satisfied:

I wasn't able to dedicate as much time to my GitHub repositories as I would like to :disappointed:

End of the year is always hectic - especially if your daughter has Birthday during the Christmas Eve and ... both of your kids got some flu and are sick for nearly two months now. :sob:

Anyway - I plan to get back to more frequent blogging - a lot of drafts awaits - and coding!

## The Great ~~Fear~~ News

There was an email from a specific `FROM:` I was afraid to receive. The `MVP Global Administrator`.
It cameon on Saturday and it began with:

![MVP]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/posts/the-great-news/picture1.png)

I'm thrilled and humbled to join the ranks of so many great people!

It's still a distant thought - like it has happened to someone else!

## Thank-You Part

I would like to thank all those who helped me be where I am now.

The biggest :heart: goes to my familly for neverending support.

Then - to all bloggers - I've learnt so much from you since my journey began that my only choice was to give it back!

The first `kick` came after I met Jeffrey Snover in 2016 during first PSConf and then again in 2017 at the very same conference!  
PPoSh was founded and grounded then and the fun-ride began!

When I was preparing my first two talks for PSConf 2018, my son (8-year-old back then) approached me and asked - `Daddy, what do you get from this? Are you being paid?`

I smiled and instantly answered - 'No, I get nothing for this'. And before I was able to add anything else another question came `So why do you do this?`

Then I paused for a second and replied
> 'I've put it wrong. I'm not being paid, but I get a LOT. I get to know fantastic, open minded and always willing to help people. I can learn from THEM. People I follow, read everyday and learn from 'remotely'. I can meet them in person! Yea, the cost is that I'm petrified for 2 hours (2 talks!) but it's not much comparing to the benefit of it.'

Then I asked him what would he do, if someone would help him with his homework. He replied he would help them too.

> 'So this is why I do this' I've added. 'I cannot help THOSE people as they are far away and know more than I do, but I can help others. Help them and share what I already know'.

Don Jones describes it best in [Be The Master](https://donjones.com/be-the-master)!

And so, with this year coming I plan to do the same!

We're running [PPoSh Meetups](https://www.meetup.com/Polish-PowerShell-Group-PPoSh) monthly - probably visiting more cities in Poland. I'm going to more [SysOps Devops meetups](https://www.meetup.com/SysOpsWro/) as well.

I'm honored to join [PS Conf EU 2020](https://psconf.eu) speaker ranks once again!

And it is just the first half of 2020!

## MVP

I still cannot belive this :grin:
