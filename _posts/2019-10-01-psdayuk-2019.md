# What a day!

This year I had the chance to come to Birmingham for a day full of PowerShell.  
And what a day it was!  
Daniel Krebs along with his team made a great effort to create an event to remember.  
There were three tracks with 5 sessions each having a unique topic and personal experience of the presenter.
We also had time for networking in between the sessions -
 which is the most important part of these events!

Being a one-day event makes it very exhausting as most of people arrive and leave at the same day.  
Yet I had the opportunity to meet my 'old friends' and make new ones!

### Thank you all

## Slides and code

As you can see there were quite a few of us there!

I talked about Pester and Azure Log Analytics - similar to my PS Conf EU talk.

How to manage and run Pester tests on-premises and use Azure Log Analytics and PowerBI to consume the results. The hidden gem here is that you get a documented AD environment in json files so you can easily store it in git!  
And it's all easy to set it up by yourself thanks to [pChecksAD PowerShell Module](https://github.com/mczerniawski/pChecksAD)!
From Zero to Full Deployment in minutes!

If you're interested in slides and code they are on my [GitHub](https://github.com/mczerniawski/Presentations/tree/master/2019-09-28-PSDayUK).

You can also find there code and slides from my other talks.
